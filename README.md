How to build an Arduino Robot
Today, we will be building a fully functional robot capable of moving 
around and avoiding obstacles in its path. The robot uses the Ultrasonic
 distance sensor to measure the distance in front of it.
 When this distance reduces to a particular level, the robot interprets it
 to mean the presence of an obstacle in its path. When the robot detects an 
obstacle in its path, it stops, goes backward for a few cms, looks around(right and left) 
then turn towards the direction that shows more free space in front of it.
 As you are going to find out, building this impressive little robot is extremely fun
 and easy as it will take only a few hours to put everything together.
 After which you can use my code directly or modify it to implement the behavioral
 pattern you desire for the robot. It is a great learning experience and great introduction 
 to robotics for kids and adults. Letâ€™s build it!
